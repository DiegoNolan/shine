# Shine <small>(let me know if you think of a better name)</small> - Declarative Graphics for the Web

Heavily inspired by `gloss`

**Work In Progress!**

## Compiling

You'll need `ghcjs` and `ghcjs-dom` (which comes preinstalled I think).

Simply import the library and run `ghcjs Yourprogram.hs`

## Usage

See `Example.hs` (a simple animation)
